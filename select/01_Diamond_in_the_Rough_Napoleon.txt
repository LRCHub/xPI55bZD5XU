Our predecessors turn in their graves
We are the age of the weak and ashamed

An eon for no pioneers or paladins
In a dying world where it's hate that wins

Once upon a time when we were one
We were united when we came undone

But we're blind to our own blindness
You sigh and say
How can I make a difference?

Spreading hate and aggression
And now death is a blessing

God has blocked the entrance
To our existence and burned the evidence

Be a diamond in the rough
Now all our love is out of touch

We tread to trip in their trenches of squalor
Drinking delusion from their dirty water

Choke on the lies that you've fed
They wanna watch you burn to fucking death

Stamped and tagged so we can't cover our tracks
Born and bred battery farmed

But we are too blind and brain dead to see
What's really happening underneath

And now we breed just to harbour and hold some fucking greed

Spreading hate and aggression
And now death is a blessing

God has blocked the entrance
To our existence and burned the evidence

Be a diamond in the rough
Now all our love is out of touch
Be a diamond in the rough
Now all our love is out of touch

The blood has risen and started to thicken
No wisdom with addiction to income

Choke on the lies that you've fed
They wanna watch you burn to fucking death

In this time of doubt
Where no light is found

You won't bring us down
So can you hear us now?

In this beautiful world that we can create
We must fight back at the inhumane

In this beautiful world that we can create
We must fight back at the inhumane
