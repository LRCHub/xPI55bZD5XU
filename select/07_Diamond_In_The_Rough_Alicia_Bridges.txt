You've heard the way people talk about me
Do you like the things they say
Or do you find it disconcerting and unkind
It's a joke I've learned to live with
Being different from the crowd
They'd like to polish me up
Give me a trim, water me down, make me be like them

But I'm a diamond in the rough
A diamond in the rough
Taking my time
Deciding when to shine
Diamond in the rough
Diamond in the rough

Diamond in the rough
Diamond in the rough

I had hoped that you would love me
Since I could fall in love with you
Could we find our place in each other somewhere tonight
Oh, I hope so
Or has the talk decayed the beauty
That we once began to find
Would you like to polish me up
Give me a trim, water me down, make me be like them

I'm still a diamond in the rough
A diamond in the rough
Taking my time, deciding when to shine
Diamond in the rough
Diamond in the rough

Diamond in the rough, diamond in the rough
