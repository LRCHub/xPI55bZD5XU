Diamond in the rough
I know you've had it tough
A woman sure gets judged
In a man's game

Empire may rule the world
I'm only livin' for you, girl
And I can see you as you twirl
Diamond in the rough

Diamond in the rough
Honey, that's what you are
I've been minin' all the bars
Just lookin' for you

Jewel of the night
How I long to hold you tight
With the neon burnin' bright
Diamond in the rough

You're a diamond to me
Any fool can plainly see
That what you got's worth twice as much
As anythin' can be

More precious than gold
Or any money I might hold
The glitter will never get old
Diamond in the rough

You're a diamond to me
Any fool can plainly see
That what you got's worth twice as much
As anythin' can be

Empire may rule the world
I'm only livin' for you, girl
And I can see you as you twirl
Diamond in the rough
